          <h2>Apologies from my heart ❤️✨</h2>
          <p>
            There’s not a single day that goes by where I don’t regret what I
            did. The last thing I ever wanted was to hurt you, yet I did, and
            for that, I am truly, deeply sorry. I wish I could go back and undo
            my mistakes, take back the words that hurt you, and replace them
            with the love and understanding you deserve. The truth is, you mean
            more to me than I can put into words. Hurting you was never my
            intention, and if I could, I would take away every bit of pain I
            caused.I know that apologies alone aren’t enough—they don’t erase
            the past, and they don’t automatically fix things. But I hope you
            can see how much I’ve reflected, how much I want to be better, and
            how much I still care about you. I don’t want to just say sorry; I
            want to show you that I’ve learned, that I’ve grown, and that I will
            never take what we had for granted again. No matter where this
            journey takes us, I need you to know that my heart has always been
            with you. And it always will be.💖

          <p>
            I know that trust, once broken, isn’t easily repaired. I know that
            words alone can’t erase the past, and I don’t expect them to. But
            what I do know—without a doubt—is that what we had was real, and
            something real is always worth fighting for. I’m not asking for a
            second chance just because I miss you. I’m asking for it because I
            truly believe we can be better. I’ve taken the time to reflect on my
            mistakes, to understand where I went wrong, and to become the person
            you always deserved. I promise to show you, not just tell you, that
            I’ve changed. That I will love you better, listen more, and never
            take you for granted again. I don’t expect things to go back to how
            they were overnight. But if you’re willing to take this journey with
            me—step by step, at your own pace—I’ll be right here, doing
            everything I can to make sure you never regret giving me one more
            chance. 💕

          <h2>Grateful for You🌹❤</h2>
          <p>
            I just wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate
            you. From the very start, you’ve been someone truly special—someone
            I admire more than words can express. Meeting you, being in
            relationship with you, has been a gift. Your kindness, your
            presence, and the way you make every conversation feel meaningful
            mean more to me than you know. I’m grateful that our paths crossed
            special thanks to Instagram notes, and no matter what the future
            holds, I’ll always be thankful for you. Some people leave a mark on
            our hearts without even trying—and you are one of them. 💕

            From the moment, I had made that mistake you’ve been on my mind in
            every way possible. Your kindness, your beauty, your
            energy—everything about you feels so special to me. You make my
            world brighter, my days better, and my heart a little fuller. I
            don’t know what the future holds, but I do know one thing—I’d love
            to have you by my side. So, here’s my question, straight from the
            heart… Will you be mine once again? 💖💕
